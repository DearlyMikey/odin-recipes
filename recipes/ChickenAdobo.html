        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Adobo is a classic Filipino dish made by braising chicken in a savory, tangy, and slightly sweet mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns. 
            Often simmered until the meat is tender and infused with rich flavor, it's a comforting, deeply flavorful stew that showcases the balance of salty, sour, and umami typical of Filipino cuisine. 
            Chicken adobo is commonly served over steamed white rice, allowing the bold, aromatic sauce to soak in. 
            It's a staple in Filipino households and considered the unofficial national dish of the Philippines.</p>
