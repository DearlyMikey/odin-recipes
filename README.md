# odin-recipes

Hello! This project is part of the HTML section of The Odin Project.

In this project, I'm to make a recipe website for three different foods. 
For each of these recipe pages, there must a picture of the food, an unordered list of the ingredients, and a step by step on how to cook the food.

Some skills that I demonstrate throughout this is handling images, using different types of headers for priorities, and using ordered and unordered lists!
